# üéì Student Dropout Prediction (Machine Learning Project)

This project builds a binary classification model to predict student dropout behavior using a Random Forest Classifier. The model is trained with optimized hyperparameters via GridSearchCV and includes a preprocessing step using `StandardScaler`.



---

## ‚úÖ Objective

The main goal is to identify students likely to drop out (class `1`) versus those who are not (class `0`), using demographic and academic-related features.

## üß™ Model Pipeline

1. **Preprocessing:**
   - Applied `StandardScaler` to scale numerical features.

2. **Model:**
   - Trained a `RandomForestClassifier`.
   - Performed hyperparameter tuning using `GridSearchCV` with 4-fold cross-validation.

confusion matrix 
497  72
74 242
True Negative (TN = 497) These are students who didn‚Äôt drop out and the model correctly predicted they wouldn‚Äôt.
False Positive (FP = 72) These are students who didn‚Äôt drop out, but the model incorrectly predicted they would.
False Negative (FN = 74) These are students who actually dropped out, but the model missed them.
True Positive (TP = 242) These are students who did drop out, and the model correctly predicted that.
